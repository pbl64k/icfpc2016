Greetings, O Most Respected and Honorable Judges of this Contest!

I humbly submit to you that my "solution" should be considered a strong contender
for your discretionary prize.

Firstly, because it is not a solution at all. As I am horribly allergic to planar
geometry, especially to its algorithmic aspects, I never made much progress on
implementing... well, anything particularly relevant to solving the problem in
general. The only thing my "solver" can do is fold the unit square into a smaller
rectangle aligned with coordinate axes, and then project this rectangle towards the
target bounding box, again, aligned with coordinate axes. And yet, despite the
sheer brain-deadness of this approach to the problem, I managed to stay as high as
#34 at the leaderboard freeze. Well, given the final push, I don't have high hopes
of staying in the top 50, but I still think this kind of tenacity may be deserving
of a honorable mention.

Secondly, I used a similarly outrageous approach to designing my problems. I
produced them by hand, literally. At least the ones even remotely interesting. Oh
the countless hours spent folding small pieces of grid paper into intricate
figures! Then computing destination coordinates using no technology more
sophisticated than pencil, notepad and excessive amounts of swearing under one's
breath. It's a testament to the fact that in the land of NP-hardness stone age tech
sometimes remains within the shouting distance of all those newfangled modern
approaches.

And lastly, the clever and humorous team name that I participated under is a
reminder of what this contest should really have been about. (Generic recursion
schemes for fixed points of arbitrary strictly positive functors, that is. Would
I have had an unfair advantage were that the case? I sure would! There are plenty
of people who actually had unfair advantage in the contest that happened, though,
because their brains are capable of figuring out how to compute whether a point is
inside a convex polygon. So there.)

And now, having laid my case in front of you, I humbly await your judgement.
